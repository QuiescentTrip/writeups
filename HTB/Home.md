In this project I will try to do writeup on everything I do on hackthebox.com.
This includes HTB academy.

So "BOX" includes every HTB machine that i have tried.
And "Academy" includes every course I've gone through.

### **Not finished:**
```dataview
list 
from "BOX" where finished = "false"
```
### **Finished:**
```dataview
list
from "BOX" where finished = "true"
```
### Still need to finish writeup:
```dataview
list
from "BOX" where finished = "true" and writeup = "false"
```
